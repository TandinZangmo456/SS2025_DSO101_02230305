# Practical 4 Report on Jenkins Server for a git repository

## Objectives

The main objective of this practical was to setup jenkins server and implement CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application. The process involves setting up jenkins with the necessary plugins, configuring Node.js and integrating the git-based workflow on the application. 

## Steps Involved
### 1. **Installation of plugins** 
- NodeJS Plugin (for Node.js tool auto-installation).
- Git Plugin (for SCM integration).
- Pipeline Plugin (for defining pipelines as code).

## Conclusion
In this practical 4, i implemented jenkins CI/CD pipeline for a node.js application successfully. It can run test, generate test reports, build application and deploy it whenever there is changes made in the repository ensuring streamlined and reliable CI/CD process.
